# Mathify 😀
Full-stack application using Python Django. Users can log in and discuss various math problems and use the built-in calculators provided by our website.

# Setup: 
* The first thing to do is to clone the repository:
* $ git clone https://github.com/Ryan11c/mathify.git 
* $ cd mathify 

# Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:
* $ virtualenv2 --no-site-packages env 
* $ source env/bin/activate 

# Then install the dependencies:
* (env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
* Note the (env) in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal session operates in a virtual environment set up by virtualenv2.

# Once pip has finished downloading the dependencies: 
* (env)$ cd myProject 
* (env)$ python manage.py runserver

# This project was very fun to make! I hope you guys enjoy it too 👍
