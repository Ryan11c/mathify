# Mathify 😀
Full-stack application using Python Django. Users can log in and discuss various math problems and use the built-in calculators provided by our website.

# Setup: 
* The first thing to do is create a folder.
* Then clone the repository into that folder:
* $ git clone https://github.com/Ryan11c/mathify.git 

# Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:
* On Windows: 🪟
* $ python -m venv venv
* $ . venv/Scripts/activate
* Notice the virtual environment is in the root directory of the folder, not inside mathify.

# Then install the dependencies:
* (venv)$ cd mathify 
* (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
* Note the (venv) in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal session operates in a virtual environment.

# Once pip has finished downloading the dependencies: 
* (venv)$ python manage.py runserver

# This project was very fun to make! I hope you guys enjoy it too 👍
