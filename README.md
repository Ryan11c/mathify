## Setup: 
* The first thing to do is create a folder.
* Then clone the repository into that folder:
* $ git clone https://github.com/Ryan11c/mathify.git 

## Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:
* On Windows: ü™ü
* $ python -m venv venv
* $ . venv/Scripts/activate
* Notice the virtual environment is in the root directory of the folder, not inside mathify.

## Then install the dependencies:
* (venv)$ cd mathify 
* (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
* Note the (venv) in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal session operates in a virtual environment.

## Create your own secret key:
* Create a .env file in myProject directory
* Inside, put SECRET_KEY=*******
* replace ******* with your secret key

## Once pip has finished downloading the dependencies: 
* (venv)$ python manage.py makemigrations
* (venv)$ python manage.py migrate
* (venv)$ python manage.py runserver

## This project was very fun to make! I hope you guys enjoy it too üëç
